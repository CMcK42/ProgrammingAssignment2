### Introduction

This second programming assignment will require you to write an R
function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast
operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to
compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.
in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make
sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it
can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this
Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of
the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside
of an R object.


# makeCacheMatrix creates a function to set the value of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
# get the value of the matrix   
 get <- function() x

# set the value of inverse of the matrix

    setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse

# get the value of inverse of the matrix
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse)
}


# return the inverse of the matrix. 
# It checks if the inverse has been found 
# If it hasn't it computes the inverse and sets the value in the cache with
# setinverse.

# Only for a matrix that is invertible.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data.")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
## Sample run:
## > x = rbind(c(1, -1/4), c(-1/4, 1))
## > m = makeCacheMatrix(x)
## > m$get()
##       [,1]  [,2]
## [1,]  1.00 -0.25
## [2,] -0.25  1.00

## No cache in the first run
## > cacheSolve(m)
##           [,1]      [,2]
## [1,] 1.0666667 0.2666667
## [2,] 0.2666667 1.0666667

## Retrieving from the cache in the second run
## > cacheSolve(m)
## getting cached data.
##           [,1]      [,2]
## [1,] 1.0666667 0.2666667
## [2,] 0.
